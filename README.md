*Description:*
This project aims to deeply analyze the network traffic of popular streaming platforms such as YouTube, Twitch, and Spotify. Using the Wireshark tool, we investigate traffic structures, HTTPS connections, IP addresses, and port numbers. The collected data will be automatically monitored and analyzed using the Python programming language and relevant libraries (Scapy, Pyshark), allowing for a comparative evaluation of traffic densities across different platforms. Finally, the findings will be visualized with tables and graphs.

*Goals:*
* To thoroughly analyze the network traffic characteristics of YouTube, Twitch, and Spotify platforms using Wireshark.
* To identify IP addresses and port numbers used in HTTPS connections.
* To verify the ownership of detected IP addresses using whois queries.
* To develop real-time network traffic monitoring capabilities using Python (Scapy, Pyshark).
* To comparatively analyze traffic densities and packet structures across different platforms.
* To present meaningful results by visualizing the gathered data with tables and graphs.
* To professionally document project steps and findings on GitHub.
